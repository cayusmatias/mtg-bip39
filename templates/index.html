    <p>This project offers an alternative way to store your BIP39 mnemonic phrases. By leveraging the Scryfall API, we translate your mnemonic into a list of Magic: The Gathering cards, providing an innovative and memorable method to secure your cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
    
    <p>We are excited to announce that this project will be made publicly available on GitHub. This open-source approach allows anyone interested to contribute, review, and modify the code for their purposes.</p>

    <h2>Early Stage Project</h2>
    <p>Please be advised that this project is in its initial stages and has not yet been extensively tested by the community.
